## Introduction
#### **101** is a platform where you can draw and publish your own nft. 
## Getting Started
#### This project has been deployed on the bsc-testnet network using the erc20, erc721 and erc1155 standards.<br/>
## Learn More
#### You can start the project by withdrawing test tokens from the **Faucet** page to your wallet. <br/>
#### You can buy the pen, eraser and brush items on the **paint** page with the test tokens you bought, or you can buy all the items with the buy all button below and draw your own nft in the paint field.<br/>
#### We first upload the picture you have drawn with the save button on the Paint page to IPFS, this sometimes takes a long time, it is recommended to wait.<br/>
#### You can create a metadata by filling in the name and description fields of your nft with the modal that opens and you can create your nft by pressing the create button.
